# Game-Concepts
Collection of game design documentation for whatever game concepts I individually or in a team came up with

This draft of a game concept was the result of a semester-long project for GSD 403 (Top-Down Video Game Design) at UIUC, taught by Dan Cermak, former GM, VP, and VP of Product Development at Volition. The general overview of this project was a game designed around 20-min playthroughs combining metroidvania and rogue-like elements (hence the name). My final grade in the class was an A. Record of the grade received at the end of the semester can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DdTpq8ffmyJk4xi2thIwFB54K4bEzWl_/view?usp=sharing
