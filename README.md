# Game-Concepts
Collection of game design documentation for whatever game concepts I individually or in a team came up with

Metroguevania - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V1AV-A8qvfrY-a2MGQpOoo4lvGGZhzJe?usp=sharing

This draft of a game concept was the result of a semester-long project for GSD 403 (Top-Down Video Game Design) at UIUC, taught by Dan Cermak, former GM, VP, and VP of Product Development at Volition. The general overview of this project was a game designed around 20-min playthroughs combining metroidvania and rogue-like elements (hence the name). My final grade in the class was an A. Record of the grade received at the end of the semester can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DdTpq8ffmyJk4xi2thIwFB54K4bEzWl_/view?usp=sharing

Metroguevania Revised - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-64gSEUcV0e3kzNzcR5KbNmFRdMwU6zr?usp=sharing

This is the expanded draft of the Metroguevania concept previously detailed. This draft was expanded in the semester following the creation of the original draft, the result of a semester-long project for GSD 405 (Intro to the Video Game Development Process) at UIUC, also taught by Dan Cermak. The resulting developed alpha of this game can be found in my other repository, UIUC-CS-405-Final-Project-Metroguevania. Currently, I have not received a final grade for this project.
